# RFC-0000: cursor-helper: CLI for Cursor IDE power users

> **Version:** 0.1.0 | **Status:** normative | **Phase:** stable

## 3. Overview

### [RFC-0000:C-VISION] Project Vision (Informative) <a id="rfc-0000c-vision"></a>

**cursor-helper** is a Rust CLI that exposes power-user functionality for Cursor IDE—operations that the IDE does not directly surface but are essential for professional workflows.

The project exists because Cursor stores rich metadata (chat history, workspace state, project associations) in scattered locations with non-obvious formats. Moving, renaming, or reorganizing projects breaks this hidden state. This CLI provides robust tools to perform such operations while preserving all associated data.

**Target users:** Developers who:
- Reorganize their project directories
- Work across multiple machines or sync setups
- Need to recover or migrate Cursor workspace data
- Want programmatic access to Cursor's internal state

*Since: v0.1.0*

### [RFC-0000:C-SCOPE] Scope and Goals (Normative) <a id="rfc-0000c-scope"></a>

The project MUST:

1. **Preserve user data** — Never lose chat history, workspace state, or project associations
2. **Support project rename/move** — Migrate all Cursor metadata when project paths change
3. **Be cross-platform** — Work on macOS, Linux, and Windows
4. **Handle edge cases** — Symlinks, special characters, non-ASCII paths, relative paths
5. **Provide clear feedback** — Show what will change before making changes

The project SHOULD:

1. **Support backup/restore** — Export and import Cursor project state
2. **Support cleanup** — Remove orphaned metadata for deleted projects
3. **Provide inspection tools** — Query Cursor's internal state for debugging

*Since: v0.1.0*

### [RFC-0000:C-NONGOALS] Non-Goals (Normative) <a id="rfc-0000c-nongoals"></a>

The project MUST NOT:

1. **Modify Cursor's behavior** — We only manipulate stored data, not the application itself
2. **Require Cursor to be closed** — Operations SHOULD be safe while Cursor is running (with appropriate warnings)
3. **Depend on undocumented APIs** — We rely on file formats, not internal APIs that may break
4. **Replace Cursor functionality** — We supplement, not substitute

The project is NOT:

- A Cursor plugin or extension
- A general-purpose IDE data migration tool
- A backup solution for user code (only Cursor metadata)

*Since: v0.1.0*

## 4. Design

### [RFC-0000:C-PRINCIPLES] Design Principles (Normative) <a id="rfc-0000c-principles"></a>

## Data Structure First

Understand Cursor's data model before writing code:

- **Folder ID**: Path slug (`/Users/foo/bar` → `Users-foo-bar`)
- **Workspace Hash**: `MD5(absolutePath + Math.round(birthtimeMs))`
- **Storage locations**: `~/.cursor/projects/`, `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/`, `globalStorage/`

## Path Handling

Paths MUST be handled exactly as Cursor records them:

- Do NOT resolve symlinks (Cursor stores literal paths)
- Clean `.` and `..` components without filesystem resolution
- Preserve the path string Cursor originally used

## Fail-Safe Operations

1. **Validate before mutate** — Check all preconditions before modifying anything
2. **Atomic where possible** — Use rename operations, not copy-then-delete
3. **Backup on conflict** — If target exists, require explicit confirmation or backup
4. **Reversible** — Operations SHOULD be reversible or provide undo information

## Minimal Dependencies

- Prefer stdlib over external crates
- Each dependency is a liability for cross-platform builds
- Heavy dependencies (async runtimes, web frameworks) are forbidden

*Since: v0.1.0*
